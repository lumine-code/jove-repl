/**
 * ## Services API
 *
 * The Lumine Services API is a way for Lumine packages to interact with each
 * other. Hydrogen both provides and consumes _services_ to add additional
 * features to itself. `./lib/services` is our container folder for anything
 * that functions through the Lumine Services API.
 * If the service is considered a _provided service_, then it is located inside
 * of `./lib/services/provided`. If the service, however, is considered a
 * _consumed service_, then it is located inside of `./lib/services/consumed`.
 *
 * ### Consumed Services
 *
 * - [Status Bar Tile: `status-bar`](./consumed/status-bar/status-bar.js)
 *
 *   - This allows us to add kernel controls to the status bar.
 * - [Autocomplete For Any Editor: `autocomplete-plus`](./consumed/autocomplete.js)
 *
 *   - This allows us to add autocomplete to things like watches.
 *
 * ### Provided Services
 *
 * - [Autocomplete Results: `autocomplete-plus`](./provided/autocomplete.js)
 *
 *   - This allows us to provide autocomplete results that are similiar to jupyter's
 *       tab completion.
